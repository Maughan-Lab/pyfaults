## PyFaults GUI 
UPDATE 03/28/2025: GUI application added, developed by Mimi Rai

The PyFaults GUI allows you to plot simulation diffraction pattern data to observed data.
1. Start the GUI by locating the `pyfaultsGUI.py` file and running the file.
2. Upload a .txt file for the `Diffraction Pattern` field and an .xy file for the `Observed Data` field.
3. Adjust parameters as needed and click the `Generate` button to run the simulation and plot the results.
